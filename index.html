<h2 name="Transport">Transportation</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different ways to get around Lake Como without a car: private or public transportation will take you wherever you want. 
Buses, trains and boat service are a great way to move from town to town. </p>
<p>-Buses</p>
<p>Bus service is a great way to move around Lake Como and save some money. If you travel by public transport, youâ€™ll be happy to know that bus stops are just outside the main train stations: there will always be a bus that will take you to your destination. </p>
<p>-Trains</p> 
<p>On the western branch of the lake, the city of Como is the only one to have train stations. If you are travelling to other towns of the western branch and do not want to move by taxi, you will have to continue your journey by bus or by boat. </p>
<p>-Boats & Ferries</p>
<p>Boat trips are recommended to anyone who wants to experience Lake Como at its best. 
 
Whether you are visiting Lake Como for a day or staying longer, jump aboard a boat, relax and reach your favorite destination: Bellagio, Varenna, Como, or one of the historical villas on the shores of the lake. </p>
